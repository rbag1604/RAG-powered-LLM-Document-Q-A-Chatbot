## Key Features

*   **Modern React.js Frontend:** A clean and responsive user interface.
*   **FastAPI Backend:** Handles document processing and question answering efficiently.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Provides accurate and context-aware answers by grounding the responses in your uploaded document.
*   **Local Document Q&A:** Ask questions and get answers based on your PDF documents, all running locally.
*   **Persistent Vector Store:** Uses FAISS (via Langchain) for efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings.
*   **Optional Together AI Integration:** Can leverage the Together AI API (Llama 3) for enhanced language generation.  The core application can function, but the chatbot will not respond without a valid API key.
